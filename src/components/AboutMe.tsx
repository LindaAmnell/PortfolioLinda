          Hi! I'm a frontend developer with a keen eye for design and a strong
          focus on creating smooth, user-friendly experiences. I recently
          finished my frontend development education, where I gained a solid
          foundation in modern web technologies—especially React, TypeScript,
          HTML, and CSS.
        </p>
        {/* <p>
          During my internship at Etraveli Group, I had the opportunity to work
          closely with a development team, contributing to real products and
          sharpening my skills in building scalable and maintainable frontend
          solutions. Before that, I worked on the IKEA Upplysa project at Rapid
          Images, where I was responsible for rebuilding the admin interface.
          These experiences taught me a lot about real-world development,
          teamwork, and working with larger codebases.
        </p> */}

          I'm someone who enjoys solving problems and constantly learning new
          things. I care about the details, whether it's polishing a component
          or making sure the user flow feels intuitive.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not coding, you’ll find me out running, decorating my
          apartment, training my dog, or cheering for my favorite Formula 1
          team, McLaren. I believe that creativity and structure can go hand in
          hand—and that’s something I bring into both my work and my hobbies.
        </p>
