            Worked on the Upplysa project for IKEA using React and TypeScript. I
            helped rebuild an internal admin page, gaining practical experience
            with frontend structure, component-based UI, and handling real
            content.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the internship, I worked with the team following Scrum, which
            improved my teamwork and understanding of agile ways of working.
            This experience helped me get better at organizing code, working
            with others, and handling real development tasks.
